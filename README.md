# BasicListData

DataScript.sh is a simple Bash script that, when run, should create a sub directory in its current location called "Depot" in which is will create a simple list-format .csv file with some randomly generated data. This file is created every minute and timestamped. This is originally inteded to be used to generate a simple file stream to test ingestion into data-handling/pipeline systems.
